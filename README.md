City-Map
========
A simple screensaver-inspired program to draw imaginary cities.


Usage
========
There's a runnable jar and default config file in  CityMap.zip if you want to see what it looks like. Just unzip and double-click. It's fullscreen and there's no exit command, so just nuke with âŒ˜-Q or Ctrl-C or whatever.
